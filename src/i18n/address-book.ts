// The Toden address book in the address flow: the sheet that offers a saved
// address when the flow's email is recognised (a code, then a pick), and the
// sheet after the review step that saves the confirmed address to their book.
//
// Mirrors the web SDK's i18n/groups/address-book.ts (keys and wording, byte
// for byte) and the Flutter port. None of these are customisable: they
// describe the person's own Toden account, not the organisation's flow, so
// they are kept apart from DEFAULT_TEXTS, which holds customisable keys only.
